               <p> I was born <date>July 10th 1713</date> at <placeName annotationId="ent_409">Zauchtenthal near Fulneck in
                     Moravia</placeName>. Already in my second Year I experienced a grac- ious
                  Preservation of God. My Mother used to gather Grass for her Cattle, &amp;
                  generally took me along, &amp; laying me once down near a Tree, a Wolf came,
                  placed himself close by me, &amp; smelt at me. My Mother felt at once very
                  anxious, &amp; turning about to look for me, she saw the ravenous Beast with me.
                  She then run hastily towards me, and the Wolf went a few Steps back, so that she
                  could take me. My Parents reveiwed me anew as a Gift of God, and thanked him with
                  Tears for my Preservation, for they were both devout People; and having looked
                  upon me from my Birth as a gracious Gift of God, they endeavoured to educate me
                  according to his Mind, wept &amp; prayed often to God in my Behalf &amp; took all
                  possible Pains with me. In my 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I became much
                  concerned about regaining a Fellowship with God through <persName annotationId="ent_412" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus" type="both" cert="definite">Jesus Christ</persName>, because I
                  had heard my Father say, that we had lost it by the Fall of Adam, but that the
                  second Adam <persName annotationId="ent_411" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus" type="both" cert="definite">Jesus Christ</persName> had procured it again through his Sufferings and Death.

               <p> me upon this Occasion into a particular School , stirred up in my a Confidence to
                  God, so that I could converse with him quite familiarly, &amp; preserved me in
                  many Dan, gers from Deviations, giving me an Admonition when I was not on the
                  right Track. He at the same time wrought in me a Fear of falling into Sin, and
                  granted me the Grace to speak uprightly with my Parents about every Thing. By
                  which means I escaped many Temptations of the Enemy of my Soul. </p>
               <p> In the Year <date>1724</date> there was a great Awakening among the Children in
                     <placeName>Moravia</placeName>. I heard that we must get a new Heart if we will
                  be saved, &amp; that God alone was able to give it. This occasioned new Perplexity
                  in me, seeing that I was deficient herein <add>&amp;</add> I was much troubled. I
                  at the same Time looked out for some Companions, to whom I would discover this my
                  Concern, &amp; our Saviour gave me eight who had the same Mind; we often went into
                  hollow Roads and Bushes, where we were alone, &amp; wept and prayed for the new
                  Heart. A Hope was also kindled within me, that I should become a Partaker of it,
                  tho' I felt myself very unworthy. </p>
               <p> In <date>1727</date> the Persecution in <placeName>Moravia</placeName> rose to
                  that Pitch that Orders were given, that everyone should swear Allegiance to the
                  roman catholic Religion. My Mother who had a faithful Heart to our Savior, would
                  &amp; could not do it, but <note type="catchword">resolved</note>

               <p> resolved rather to emigrate. She asked me whether I would accompany her? I
                  consented directly, &amp; the Concern of our Heart to see our Souls saved, was so
                  great, that nothing could detain us. </p>
               <p> While these Things were going on, my Mothers older Brother <persName>John
                     Nitschman</persName> arrived with us from <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>, who
                  emigrated before us, to him we discovered our Intention , &amp; he being willing
                  to accompany us, my Father made directly secret Preparations for our Departure.
                  And thus we left our House &amp; Mother Country <date>June 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> 1727,</date> &amp; set out for

                  to time what he stood in Need of; to him I had discovered our Intention, shortly
                  before, &amp; had taken a very moving Leave of him. He recomended us there to the
                  Protection of the Lord, and said to me during a particular Sense of the Peace of
                  God: " I am sure I shall find thee once among the Number of those who are with the
                  Lord " On our Journey we were several times in Danger of our Lives, &amp; besides
                  this had to suffer much Distress, Hard ships &amp; Anxiety. But our Savior helped
                  us, so that we arrived safe, chearful and happy <date>July 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>.</date> at <placeName>Berthelsdorf</placeName> to our unspeak- able
                  Joy. The next Day we went to <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>, &amp; were welcomed
                  with much Affection by the little Congregation there. But we had to live yet for
                  some Time in <placeName>Berthelsdorf</placeName>. </p>
               <p> My Concern for my Salvation increased here more &amp; more. I yet remember that I

               <p> great Comunion <date>Aug. 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1727</date>, and I
                  begged the <persName annotationId="ent_2040" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus" type="both" cert="definite">Lord Jesus</persName>, <hi rend="strikethrough">attended</hi> with many Tears to
                  think also of me. I went here to School to <persName>Mr. Krumpa</persName>, who
                  often told us that he loved the Lord Jesus, because he had shed his Blood for us.
                  This excited in me a Confidence to our Savior that he probably had also shed his
                  Blood for me, &amp; would have Mercy upon me. At the Time when in
                     <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName> the great Awakening among the Children began,
                  he asked once his Scholars: Whether they also would love our Savior &amp; give him
                  their Hearts, so that He might wash them wih his Blood? With those who expressed a
                  Desire for it, he made a Covenant, to love Him above all Things who loved us
                  first. Upon which Occasion He in whose Eyes we were precious walked certainly in
                  our Midst, &amp; none of us knew what had hap, pened unto us. It occasioned a
                  great Joy in <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>, that our Savior had also graciously
                  visited the Children in <placeName><placeName annotationId="ent_2041" ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berthelsdorf" cert="definite">Berthelsdorf<precision annotationId="ent_2041" precision="high"/></placeName></placeName>. We wept &amp; prayed
                  together during an inexpressible Feeling of the Nearness of Jesus. </p>
               <p> My Parents moved soon after to <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>, where we had it
                  outwardly very pinching &amp; hard. But I must say to the Praise of our Savior,
                  that I could suit myself pretty well into poor Circumstances, for I had left my
                  Mother Country with no other Intention, than to be satisfied with Bread and Water.
                  But the H. Ghost begun a new Work in me. I learned to know our Savior as the
                  Friend of poor Sinners; he forgave me the Sin of Not believing in Him and His
                  Merit, &amp; showed me my <note type="catchword">Name</note>

               <p> Name engraven into his Hands. Now happy did my Heart feel when he cleared it up
                  to me, that His Sufferings, his Death &amp; Bloodshedding had also happened for my
                  sake, &amp; that I was his Property. I could not sufficiently contemplate our
                  Savior in his Sufferings Beauty, whereby all external Troubles &amp; Difficulties
                  were made quite easy to me. In <date>January 1729</date> I was to my inexpressible
                  Joy admitted to the H. Comunion with the Congrn. I then made |: as it was the

                  with Soul &amp; Body to my Redeemer &amp; devote to Him Life &amp; All. In this
                  blessed Enjoyment of our Savior, I went on during a particular Care of the never

                  took much Care &amp; Pain with me, till <date>1732</date> when i came to
                     <placeName>Ebersdorf</placeName>, to take Care of some young Countesses. Here I
                  was to my Heart somewhat removed from the Simplicity in Christ Jesus. But our
                  Savior, according to his great Faithfulness, did not suffer me to be plucked out
                  of his Hand, but renewed in me that Mind to devote myself to him <sic>intirely

                  the Beginning of a poor Pilgrim Life, having often at our Nights Lodgings neither
                  Bed Clothes above nor under us; and in the latter Place, there arose soon a
                  Persecution against the Brethren, so that we were obliged to leave the City. We
                  then stayed with the Pilgrim Congrn. at <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, &amp;
                  afterwards in <placeName>Wetteravia</placeName> till in <date>Oct. 1738</date>

                  granted us the Grace to testify with a hearful Heart to People in high &amp; low
                  Rank what Jesus Blood each do on Sinners <unclear>base</unclear>. I shall never
                  forget it, what a powerful Grace ruled at that Time among the Estonians &amp;
                  Lettonians. </p>
               <p> In <date>1740</date> we returned to <placeName>Marienborn</placeName>, where I
                  enjoyed a very blessed Time. The Year following |:<date>1741</date>:| we resided
                  with the Pilgrim Congrn. at Geneva and Montmirail and in <date>May 1742</date> we

                  at the time when my Husband was taken Prisoner so that it was as if he spoke
                  personally with me, comforted and sup- ported me powerfully. I simply followed his

                  <date>Jan. 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1748</date>. In Aug. the same Year I
                  moved to <placeName>Lindheim in Wetteravia</placeName> to have the Care of the

                  recieve the first Account to be depended upon from my dear Husband, by a most

                  <persName>Br. Risler</persName> came to <placeName>Marien</placeName>, born from
                     <placeName>Petersburg</placeName>, &amp; brought me by Word of Mouth good Ac,
                  counts of my dear Husband, &amp; offered me to take me along with him. This Offer
                  I received as out of the Hand of our Savior. And <date>Aug. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi></date>. I sat out with him &amp; his dear Wife
                  thither with the Blessing of <persName>Count Zinzendorf </persName>and the <hi rend="underline">Brn</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Srs</hi>. My four Children I
                  re, comended to the faithful Heart of Jesus &amp; the Congregation, &amp; my Heart
                  was then so disposed: I know that I am Jesus Pro- perty; of his Flesh &amp; of his
                  Bone, &amp; shall remain his eternally tho' I am very poor and wretched. I go with
                  that Mind to my dear Husband to do that which our Savior would have me to do, and
                  I shall continue sitting at the Feet of Jesus. The <date>29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. the same Month</date> we arrived at
                     <placeName>Petersburg</placeName>. But I had to keep myself at first very still

                  come to <placeName>Petersburg</placeName>. Besides this I grew so sick, that I
                  could not think otherwise, but that I should depart this Life without having seen
                  my Husband. Add to this that I could not even let my Husband know anything of my
                  Trouble, because whatever I wrote to him I had to regulate so that all might read
                  it, because Leave for my Journey to <placeName>Petersburg</placeName> was not yet
                  procured. This was a very hard Trial <note type="catchword">for me</note>

                  sleepless Nights in Conversation with my only Friend, wetted my Pillows with
                  Tears; Jesus Perplexities, his merit- orious Tears, &amp; nightly Prayers, were of
                  great Service to me, they strengthened &amp; comforted me, so that I could
                  childlikely resign myself to him, &amp; believe that if I even should go home to
                  Him without having seen my Husband, that he however would be my most faithful

                  This was indeed a great Joy to see each other again after so long a Time. In
                     <date>Oct. 1751</date> I obtained at last Leave to move to my dear Husband, to
                  whom Leave was granted to move with the <persName>Brn Helterhof</persName> &amp;
                     <persName>Fritshe |:Gudslef</persName> was already gone to our Savior:| into

                  ment for my sick &amp; weary Heart. But even this could not come to pass without
                  Trouble, for there came soon Counter Order that I should not yet move to my
                  Husband, &amp; I had to live 6 Days with <persName ana="Risler">Br.</persName> and
                     <persName>Sr Risler</persName> in a private Manner. However we had afterwards
                  the Pleasure to live together for some Time, which was effected by the
                  inexpressible Pain <persName>Br. Koehler</persName> took, who for our sake had to
                  put up with much Vexation &amp; Reproach. </p>

                  Water in Storm &amp; Rain. We two Sisters spent the Night weeping, &amp; when the
                  next Morning Enquiry was made of those who had carried them away, whether they had
                  been brought; we were still more frighted by fearful Accounts of their Fate. At
                  last we received the joyful News, that they had been brought to their former
                  Prison, &amp; that we might visit them. We hastened directly to them, to bring
                  them some Refreshments. This proved to be a great Joy to see those yet alive whom
                  we believed dead. To my great Astonishment I found my Husband a little better,
                  tho' sometimes so weak, that I went away in the Evening with the Thought of having
                  seen him the last Time. I spoke confidently with our Savior about there
                  Circumstances, and He convinced me that it was according to His Heart </p>

                  my Husband was also convincedof it, &amp; we encouraged each other often to be

                  Lord, and to have all our Troubles sweetened by the Converse with Him. Leave was
                  indeed given us to visit the Brethren in the Day Time as often as we pleased; but
                  there were always People who made it very difficult, <unclear>you</unclear> often
                  impossible for us, &amp; thus we got one Fright after another. And besides this
                  our Savr. took in <date>1755</date>
                  <persName>Sr. Helterhof </persName>to himself, &amp; thus I was quite alone in the
                  House with my Child. Not understanding the russian Language, &amp; being obliged
                  to leave my Child alone in the House, when I had to go out, &amp; being in
                  continual Danger of a <sic>Sur, prize</sic>

                     Grumberg </persName>who took a most faithful Care of me &amp; my Child. I had
                  also taken a russian Girl out of Compassion , who got a Love for our Savior, &amp;
                  when I went out |:for I had to carry to the Brn. all their Necessaries:| she
                  entertained my Child with Singing Verses. Once in Winter <date>1757</date> when

                  the Stream carried me a Piece along, so that I must have been drowned, if the Eye
                  &amp; Watchman of Israel had not so faithfully preserved me, But I became very
                  sickly afterwards. In this Distress I prayed fervently to our Savior, to grant me
                  the Satisfaction, to nurse the three Prisoners <note type="catchword">as</note>

                  Trouble, though it should even be done in ever so great Weakness. And this He has
                  done graciously &amp; helped me so, that through it seemed sometimes as if the

                  suffered however no Want. At this Time I had a particular Confidence in conversing
                  with our Savior. One of these Conversations in <date>Oct. 1758 </date>was very
                  imppressive to me, when I spoke fully with him about my whole Course of Life,
                  &amp; was richly comforted about all my Mistakes. In <date>Febr. 1759 </date>we
                  were at last set at Liberty, but ordered to go to Casan. We were 5 in Number, viz.
                  my Husband, the <persName>B<hi rend="underline">rn.</hi> Helterhof</persName>
                  &amp; <persName>Fritshe</persName> &amp; I &amp; my Child. On this Journey new
                  Trials came upon us. The Brethren could not bear the violent Shaking of the
                  Waggons, on the bad Roads &amp; Causeways, made of round Wood, after sitting so
                  long in Prison, &amp; they had to suffer much, particularly my Husband, who had
                  always been weak. Add to this the Fright of being attacked by Robbers on the other
                  side of <placeName>Moscovia</placeName>, who most cruelly beat our Guards; he be-
                  came quite enervated, &amp; a mortal Sickness befel him, so that he lost his
                  Speech. His Mouth was at were burnt up, &amp; his Tongue withered, I had not even
                  as much as a Drop of Water to refresh him. I often begged our Savior to comfort
                  him with his Thirst. Besides this we saw nothing but inexpressible Difficulties
                  before us. The People did not like to have any Dealings with us, because we had
                  Soldiers with us, so that we often did not know, where to get a Morsel to eat,
                  particularly as it was Lent Season, wherein the Russians are very </p>

               <p> strict. At last we arrived at <placeName>Maram</placeName> upon the
                     <placeName>River Ocke</placeName>, where we met with more friendly People,who
                  looked upon &amp; loved as par- ticular good Christians &amp; Children of God,
                  &amp; served as as well as they could. We felt well among these People, &amp; I
                  believe they will be counted among those to whom Jesus will say: I was sick and ye
                  have come to the highest Pitch, for he could not even move his Tongue, &amp; lay
                  quite speech &amp; senseless. The Creature begun now to plead with the Creator,
                  &amp; I was quite at a Loss what to think or say, when I considered that the
                  Departure of my Husband was so near at Hand. But then in my greatest Trouble,
                  &amp; when I was at the Brink of Despair, the loving Heart of Jesus interfered,
                  &amp; set Bounds to the raging Waves; for our Savior gave Strength to my Husband
                  that he in some Measure recovered, so that, to my great <sic>Surprize</sic>
                  <corr>Surprise </corr>he spoke fully with me about our Course hither to, &amp;
                  particularly about this Journey, whereas he could not speak one Word before. He
                  said among the rest: Be not discouraged about these Circumstances; thou knowest
                  that our Savior already in <date>1738</date> gave Directions, that we through
                     <placeName>Russia</placeName> should go to <placeName><sic>Assia
                           <corr>Asia</corr></sic></placeName>, but the Enemy has thrown some
                  Obstacles in the Way, so that it was stopt, about which I never could be
                  satisfied, but now our Savr., with whom I have kept up on un, interrupted
                  Conexion, amidst my Weaknesses of Soul &amp; Body has satisfied me about it, by
                  this that the russian Government itself sends us now thither, so that we however
                  shall see Asia, &amp; sojourn in it. My great Weakness is a natural Consequence of

               <p> Alteration of my Way of Life hitherto, &amp; belongs to the final Com- pletion of
                  my Sufferings. And it is a Grace to me, that also in Sufferings I am made
                  conformable to my best Friend. Our Savior well certainly restore my Health so that
                  I shall reach the Place of our Destination. In <placeName>Casan</placeName> I
                  shall probably go home to our Savior but <unclear>thote</unclear> wilt go again to
                  the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi>. with thy Child, &amp; with all our Children
                  enjoy there much Goodness &amp; Mercy from our Savr. We then pursued our Journey
                  &amp; my Husband recovered more &amp; more, yet I had to care for &amp; nurse him
                  like a Child. At last <date>Apr 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1769</date> we
                  arrived at <placeName>Casan</placeName>, having been three times in evident Danger
                  of our Lives, after we had entered the Borders of <placeName>Asia</placeName>. In
                     <placeName>Casan</placeName> we found it better, than we expected. The People
                  there showed much Love &amp; Respect to us, and even the Governor himself behaved
                  very friendly towards us. I often begged our Savior to give us at least one Soul,
                  where our Testimony of him might find Entrance, &amp; it was not a small
                  Satisfaction to us, that we could brave the Labour of the H. Ghost, with some
                  Russians and Turks. I wept &amp; prayed much both on the Journey &amp; particu-
                  larly here in behalf of the Inhabitants of this Country, &amp; I must own, that
                  when I spoke right confidently with our Savior about it, he gave me a very
                  gracious Look, &amp; the Assurance into my Heart that a Light will yet spring up
                  in this Country. <date>Nov. 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>. 1760</date>

                  <persName>Commander Plaisin</persName>, who out of Love to my Husband, procured a
                  Passport for me from <placeName>Petersburg</placeName>, that so I might safely
                  come thither. And though the Roads were very unsafe, &amp; much was heard of
                  robbing &amp; murdering, I nevertheless ventured it on our Savior, to whose Care
                  &amp; Protection I had quite anew surrendered myself; and it did not come into my
                  Mind that any Evil could happen unto me. And my Eyes flow with Tears of Gratitude
                  &amp; Abasement, when i consider how evidently our Savior has cared for me, &amp;
                  what Wonders of Grace &amp; Mercy he has shewn unto me. Just when I was going to
                  set out on my Journey &amp; had called upon to accompany me , it was ordered so,
                  that a Libonian <persName>Captain Durnstern</persName> had to travel the same Way;
                  he took me gladly into his Company &amp; we set out <date>Jan. 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. 1761</date> from <placeName>Casan</placeName>.
                  My taking Leave of <persName>Br. Helterhof</persName> who of the three captive
                     B<hi rend="underline">rn</hi> alone was left, is known to our Savior, &amp; not
                  to be expressed in Words. The Captain shewed in expressible Love &amp;
                  Faithfulness to me &amp; my Child, &amp; more than once ventured his Life for our
                  sakes particularly <date>Jan. 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.</date> when it had
                  the Appearance as if we should find our Graves in the <placeName>River
                     Wolga</placeName>; for the Ice begun to sink, &amp; to get Holes, &amp; some of
                  the first Sleds fell already in the Water. We could not think of turning or
                  evading it, for on one Side was already upon Water above the Ice &amp; on the
                  other was a very steep high Shore. In this Distress came the Captain through the
                  Water to us, broke off Branches from the Bushes which grew along the Shore, &amp;
                  covered the Holes with them, &amp; himself led our Horses over them. And thus with
                  the Help of God, we were de- livered out of this Distress, in which we had been
                  from Noon till towards <note type="catchword">Midnight</note>

               <p> Midnight. The Captain cared for me &amp; my Child throughout the whole Journey
                  like a Father, did not only pay all Expences, but let always one of his Servants
                  stay with us, &amp; when distressing Circumstances occurred he himself with some
                  others hastened to our Assistance. He everywhere gave us out to be his Relations,
                  &amp; took Care of our Things in the best Manner. I brought my Child very sick of
                  the small Pox to <placeName>Mascovia</placeName>; but as the Captain would take me
                  with him as far as <placeName>Novograd</placeName>. I set out with my Child sick
                  as it was, &amp; our Savior prevented all ill Consequences. But in
                     <placeName>Novograd</placeName> where our Road parted, the Captain was very un,
                  easy about me, particularly as he had heard of his Servants, that my Drivers had
                  evil Designs against me, as soon as we should be alone. But in this Perplexity, we
                  met quite unexpectedly, &amp; to our Joy, as russian <persName>Lieutenant of the
                     Guard Milkanoth</persName>, who was a good Friend of the Captain, &amp; also
                  knew <persName>Br. Koehler</persName> in <placeName>Petersburg</placeName> very
                  well, who was also travelling thither. I took Leave of my Bene, factor with a
                  thankful Heart, and he delivered me to the Lieutenant as his Relation, &amp;
                  begged him to pay strict Attention to our Things &amp; Drivers, &amp; not suffer
                  them to stay behind with me, saying: All you do unto her I shall look upon as done
                  unto myself. The Lieutenant executed also his Commission in the best Manner, and
                  our Savr. brought us safe &amp; well to <placeName>Petersburg</placeName>

                  thankful was I to be again among Brn. and Srs. But I met again with Difficulties
                  on account of my farther Journey, everybody representing it to me as impossible to
                  get a Passport. But according to my Custom I re- comended also this Affair to my
                  dear Lord, &amp; begged him to take it in Hand himself &amp; execute it. And this
                  he did also to my great Joy &amp; Abasement, for he directed Matters so, that I

               <p> the Name of the Ambassador of Saxony. Having now rested here a little after so
                  many sleepless Nights, Dangers, Troubles &amp; Distress, I sat out from
                     <placeName>Petersburg</placeName> by Water, with my little Daughter, whom I had
                  preserved as a particular Gift with all possible Care &amp; Faithfulness,
                  accompanied by <persName>Br. Kryman</persName>, <date>May 18th. 1761</date>. The
                  taking Leave of the Brn. &amp; Srs. here was very painful on both Sides. Towards
                  Evening we set Sail, but we soon got a Storm, which was against us, &amp; a total
                  Eclipse of the Moon rendered it quite dark, so that we saw nothing before us but
                  our Destruction, particularly as our Vessel was too deeply laden, &amp; the
                     <placeName>Neva</placeName> being in that Place full of Sand Banks. </p>

               <p> We returned in great Danger &amp; sailed again the next Day for
                     <placeName>Cronstadt</placeName>. Here I had again new Troubles, but our Savior
                  helped me thro', &amp; we could now pursue our Voyage without any Hindrance. I now
                  looked once more at the Land of my Troubles with Tears in my Eyes, &amp;
                  recomended it to the faithful Heart of Jesus. So as the faithful Eye &amp;
                  Watchman of Israel watched hitherto over me on my Journies, so I experienced it
                  also on my farther Travels by Sea &amp; Land. It was as if the Arms of my dear
                  Savior enclosed me around, especially at <placeName>Lüneburg</placeName> on the
                  rest of my Journey. During the Time of our Abode at
                     <placeName>Lüneburg</placeName> which lasted 10 Days there were every Day such
                  violent Storms of Thunder &amp; Lightning as no, body remembered ever to have
                  seen, but when we sat out the Weather was fair &amp; pleasant. And tho' that whole
                  District was then sur- rounded with War, we saw nothing of it, &amp; arrived at
